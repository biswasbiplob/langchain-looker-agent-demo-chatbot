# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Start the Application
- **Development**: `python main.py` (starts on localhost:5000)
- **Production**: `gunicorn app:app` (use for production deployment)

### Database Operations
- **Initialize Database**: `python -c "from app import db; db.create_all()"`
- **Reset Database**: Remove `instance/chatbot.db` file and reinitialize
- **Database Migrations**: Tables are auto-created on app startup, including new caching tables

### Dependencies
- **Install**: `uv sync` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Using UV**: This project is configured for UV package manager (see pyproject.toml)

### Testing
- **Run All Tests**: `python tests/run_tests.py` (runs all test suites)
- **Run Individual Tests**:
  - Direct Looker Query Test: `python tests/test_direct_query.py`
  - Chatbot Agent Test: `python tests/test_chatbot.py`
  - Basic Database Caching Test: `python tests/test_basic_caching.py` (no credentials needed)
  - Full Database Caching Test: `python tests/test_database_caching.py` (requires Looker credentials)
  - Semantic Search Test: `python tests/test_semantic_search.py` (tests field-level keyword matching)
  - Comprehensive Similarity Search Test: `python tests/test_similarity_search.py` (tests fuzzy model matching)
  - Enhanced Model Selection Test: `python tests/test_improved_model_selection.py` (requires credentials)
  - Database Tables Test: `python tests/test_db_tables.py`
- **Test Requirements**: Ensure all environment variables are set before running tests

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **app.py**: Main Flask application with all routes, authentication, and CORS setup
- **chat_agent.py**: LookerChatAgent class that interfaces with Looker BI via langchain-looker-agent
- **models.py**: SQLAlchemy models (User, ChatSession, ChatError) for database persistence
- **main.py**: Application entry point (imports from app.py)

### Database Models
- **User**: Authentication with per-user Looker credentials storage
- **ChatSession**: Conversation logging for analytics
- **ChatError**: Error tracking for monitoring
- **LookerModel**: Database caching of Looker model metadata (24-hour cache)
- **LookerExplore**: Database caching of Looker explore metadata with dimensions/measures (24-hour cache)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates for login/register pages and demo interface
- **Static Assets**: Embeddable JavaScript widget (widget.js) and CSS (widget.css)
- **Widget Integration**: Standalone chatbot widget for embedding on external websites

### Authentication Flow
- Flask-Login with session-based authentication
- Per-user credential storage in database (Looker API keys, OpenAI keys)
- Both authenticated (database-stored) and widget (localStorage-based) credential handling

### Looker Integration
- Uses Looker SDK directly for BI queries and model discovery
- Automatic model and explore discovery - no manual model configuration required
- **Enhanced AI-powered model/explore selection** with multi-layered search:
  1. **Semantic Search**: Field-level keyword matching with cached metadata
  2. **Comprehensive Similarity Search**: Fuzzy matching across ALL models/explores when semantic search fails
  3. **Exact Model Queries**: Direct handling of "is there a model called X?" questions
- Intelligent keyword extraction and domain-specific term expansion (e.g., "ab test" â†’ "experiment", "variant", "winner")
- Database caching of models and explores with detailed field metadata (24-hour cache refresh)
- Semantic scoring based on field names, descriptions, and explore metadata
- Fallback mechanisms ensure relevant suggestions even when exact matches aren't found
- Requires JDBC driver (looker-jdbc.jar) for database connections
- Dynamic agent creation based on user credentials or environment variables
- Chat history context maintained in Flask sessions

### API Endpoints
- `/api/chat`: Main chat processing with Looker agent
- `/api/auth/*`: Authentication endpoints (login/register/logout/status)
- `/api/settings`: User credential management
- `/api/test-connection`: Looker connection verification

### Test Architecture
- **tests/**: Centralized test directory containing all test scripts
- **test_direct_query.py**: Tests direct Looker SDK connectivity and dynamic model discovery
- **test_chatbot.py**: Tests the LookerChatAgent with various query scenarios including AI-powered model selection
- **test_database_caching.py**: Tests database caching functionality for models and explores
- **test_db_tables.py**: Tests database table creation including new caching tables
- **run_tests.py**: Test runner that executes all test suites sequentially
- All tests work without LOOKML_MODEL_NAME and require proper environment configuration (Looker + OpenAI credentials)

## Key Environment Variables

Required for Looker integration:
- `LOOKER_BASE_URL`: Looker instance URL
- `LOOKER_CLIENT_ID`: API client ID  
- `LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET`: API client secret
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For natural language processing
- `JDBC_DRIVER_PATH`: Path to Looker JDBC driver JAR

**Note**: `LOOKML_MODEL_NAME` is no longer required - the system now automatically discovers and works with all available models using intelligent model selection based on user queries.

Optional:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection (defaults to SQLite)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Flask session secret
- `JAVA_HOME`: Java installation path (for JDBC driver)

## Deployment Notes

### Database Configuration
- Development: SQLite (`instance/chatbot.db`)
- Production: PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`
- Auto-creates tables on app startup

### CORS Configuration
- Configured for cross-domain widget embedding
- Supports credentials for authenticated sessions
- Allows all origins (adjust for production security)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling in chat_agent.py with user-friendly messages
- Database logging of errors and chat sessions
- Agent initialization failures handled gracefully
