## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **app.py**: Main Flask application with all routes, authentication, and CORS setup
- **chat_agent.py**: LookerChatAgent class that interfaces with Looker BI via langchain-looker-agent
- **models.py**: SQLAlchemy models (User, ChatSession, ChatError) for database persistence
- **main.py**: Application entry point (imports from app.py)

### Database Models
- **User**: Authentication with per-user Looker credentials storage
- **ChatSession**: Conversation logging for analytics
- **ChatError**: Error tracking for monitoring
- **LookerModel**: Database caching of Looker model metadata (24-hour cache)
- **LookerExplore**: Database caching of Looker explore metadata with dimensions/measures (24-hour cache)
- **LookerDashboard**: Database caching of Looker dashboard metadata with business context (24-hour cache)
- **DashboardExploreMapping**: Business context mapping between dashboards and explores

### Frontend Architecture
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates for login/register pages and demo interface
- **Static Assets**: Embeddable JavaScript widget (widget.js) and CSS (widget.css)
- **Widget Integration**: Standalone chatbot widget for embedding on external websites

### Authentication Flow
- Flask-Login with session-based authentication
- Per-user credential storage in database (Looker API keys, OpenAI keys)
- Both authenticated (database-stored) and widget (localStorage-based) credential handling

### Looker Integration
- Uses Looker SDK directly for BI queries and model discovery
- Automatic model and explore discovery - no manual model configuration required
- **Enhanced AI-powered model/explore selection** with multi-layered search:
  1. **Semantic Search**: Field-level keyword matching with cached metadata
  2. **Comprehensive Similarity Search**: Fuzzy matching across ALL models/explores when semantic search fails
  3. **Exact Model Queries**: Direct handling of "is there a model called X?" questions
- Intelligent keyword extraction and domain-specific term expansion (e.g., "ab test" â†’ "experiment", "variant", "winner")
- Database caching of models and explores with detailed field metadata (24-hour cache refresh)
- Semantic scoring based on field names, descriptions, and explore metadata
- Fallback mechanisms ensure relevant suggestions even when exact matches aren't found
- Requires JDBC driver (looker-jdbc.jar) for database connections
- Dynamic agent creation based on user credentials or environment variables
- Chat history context maintained in Flask sessions

### Dashboard Query System (Enhanced Feature)
- **Dashboard-Specific Query Detection**: Automatically detects queries asking specifically about dashboards
  - Recognizes patterns: "is there a dashboard for X", "show me dashboards about Y", "find a dashboard for Z"
  - Highest priority routing ensures dashboard queries get specialized handling
- **Enhanced Dashboard Search & Matching**:
  - **Real-World Optimized Scoring**: Designed for production Looker instances with potentially empty descriptions
  - **Bi-Weekly Specific Matching**: Special handling for "bi-weekly", "biweekly", "bi weekly" queries
  - **Domain-Specific Recognition**: Cost/Finance, Experiments, User Analytics domain awareness
  - **Folder-Based Context**: Uses dashboard folders for business context scoring
  - **Penalty System**: Reduces relevance for obvious domain mismatches
- **Comprehensive Dashboard Response Format**:
  - Dashboard title with folder/space context
  - Business-friendly descriptions (when available)
  - **Direct clickable URLs** to actual Looker dashboards
  - Related explores for deeper analysis
  - Multiple relevant dashboard suggestions with ranking
- **Enhanced Dashboard Fetching**: 
  - Fetches comprehensive dashboard metadata including tags, folders, spaces
  - Increased limit (100+ dashboards) to ensure target dashboards aren't missed
  - Robust error handling for missing dashboard metadata
  - Debug logging for dashboard discovery and scoring

### API Endpoints
- `/api/chat`: Main chat processing with Looker agent
- `/api/auth/*`: Authentication endpoints (login/register/logout/status)
- `/api/settings`: User credential management
- `/api/test-connection`: Looker connection verification

### Test Architecture
- **tests/**: Centralized test directory containing all test scripts
- **test_direct_query.py**: Tests direct Looker SDK connectivity and dynamic model discovery
- **test_chatbot.py**: Tests the LookerChatAgent with various query scenarios including AI-powered model selection
- **test_database_caching.py**: Tests database caching functionality for models and explores
- **test_db_tables.py**: Tests database table creation including new caching tables
- **run_tests.py**: Test runner that executes all test suites sequentially
- All tests work without LOOKML_MODEL_NAME and require proper environment configuration (Looker + OpenAI credentials)

## Key Environment Variables

Required for Looker integration:
- `LOOKER_BASE_URL`: Looker instance URL
- `LOOKER_CLIENT_ID`: API client ID  
- `LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET`: API client secret
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For natural language processing
- `JDBC_DRIVER_PATH`: Path to Looker JDBC driver JAR

**Note**: `LOOKML_MODEL_NAME` is no longer required - the system now automatically discovers and works with all available models using intelligent model selection based on user queries.

Optional:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection (defaults to SQLite)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Flask session secret
- `JAVA_HOME`: Java installation path (for JDBC driver)

## Deployment Notes

### Database Configuration
- Development: SQLite (`instance/chatbot.db`)
- Production: PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`
- Auto-creates tables on app startup

### CORS Configuration
- Configured for cross-domain widget embedding
- Supports credentials for authenticated sessions
- Allows all origins (adjust for production security)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling in chat_agent.py with user-friendly messages
- Database logging of errors and chat sessions
- Agent initialization failures handled gracefully

## Dashboard Query Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Dashboard queries return wrong/irrelevant dashboards
**Root Cause**: Target dashboard not being found or scored properly
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Dashboard Fetching**: Verify the target dashboard is being retrieved from Looker API
   - Look for log message: `Key dashboard found - ID: {target_id}, Title: '{title}', Folder: '{folder}'`
   - If missing, dashboard may be beyond the 100-dashboard fetch limit or have access restrictions

2. **Debug Dashboard Scoring**: Check logs for dashboard scoring information  
   - Look for: `Dashboard '{title}' scored {score} - {reason}`
   - Scores above 80 indicate high relevance, above 40 medium relevance

3. **Verify Keywords**: Ensure query keywords match dashboard titles/descriptions
   - "bi-weekly" should match dashboards with "bi-weekly", "biweekly", or "bi weekly" in title
   - "cost" should match dashboards with "cost", "finops", "billing", "finance" terms

#### Issue: Dashboard descriptions showing "No description available"
**Root Cause**: Looker API not returning description fields or dashboards lacking descriptions
**Solutions**:
1. **Relies on Title Matching**: System is optimized to work with title-only matching when descriptions are unavailable
2. **Folder Context**: Uses dashboard folder/space names for additional context
3. **Domain-Specific Logic**: Recognizes cost, experiment, and analytics domains from titles alone

#### Issue: Specific dashboard (e.g., ID 2659) not appearing in results
**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check if dashboard is being fetched: Look for log `Key dashboard found - ID: 2659`
2. If not found, dashboard may be:
   - Beyond fetch limit (increase limit in get_available_dashboards)
   - In a restricted folder/space
   - Not accessible with current user permissions
3. If found but not in top results, check scoring logs to see why it scored low

### Performance Optimization
- Dashboard fetching limited to 100 dashboards to prevent API timeouts
- 24-hour database caching reduces API calls
- Comprehensive error handling ensures graceful degradation
